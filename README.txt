It should be seperated into 2 files, Chromatics, And Characters.

Explaing what shit means:

Chroms: In each chromatic folder there should be 3 audio files, "CharacterName Chrom short" "CharacterName Chrom short alt" and "CharacterName Chrom long"
Some won't have an alt audio file meaning it only has one vowel, The alt audio files have the same note length as the normal short exept with vowels switched around.
just incase specific vowels in specific pitches sound bad you can use the alternative version, Long is just long notes. They aren't all long because long notes have a weird beginning. 

Characters: In each character folder there is a single audio file (exept some like austin) 
these are there because there is nno point of making a chromatic cause it's a single vowel and most of the time it is an instrument,
 so it already sounds fine through normal pitching, So no chromatic needed

How to use:

Chroms: Every chrom audio file has it's corresponding FST file For slicex, Just openn the fst file and it should open slicex, 
It should be auto sliced so just openn piano roll and have fun! they might not all sounnd perfect so i'm sorry 
if vowels sound bad for a specific pattern switch to the previously mentioned alt chromatic

Characters: Since most of the character files include a single voweled instrument or voice you don't really need a chromatic, Simple drag and drop onto the channel rack,
Then once it's there left click it until you see a little graph thing pop up. At the top there should be 3 buttons, A sound wave which is already selected,  A wrench
And a triangle thinng. Click the triangle thing. Now you can see the envelope settings, Turn Delay, Att, Sus, and rel ALL the way down. Then turn hold all the way up
So it looks like a square. Now open piano roll and map out whatever you want or paste a pattern and adjust to find the right pitch

you don't really need utau since everything is already a predone chromatic but just incase
