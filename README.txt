THIS IS MEANT FOR FL STUDIO CAUSE IDK HOW OTHER PROGRAMS WORK SO INSTRUCTIONS MIGHT VARY

Explaing what shit means:

Chroms: in each character folder there will be 1-3 fst files, A chrom short, Chrom Short alt, And Chrom long. Some may not have a long or a short alt but the short alt
Means the vowels are different for each note compared to the short, Just incase the chrom short sounds bad with those vowels
The long is just long notes cause sometimes utau sound weird with long notes, not all will have it tho

How to use:

Chroms: Every chrom audio file has it's corresponding FST file For slicex, Just openn the fst file and it should open slicex, 
It should be auto sliced so just openn piano roll and have fun! they might not all sounnd perfect so i'm sorry 
if vowels sound bad for a specific pattern switch to the previously mentioned alt chromatic, unless there isn't one
